It is already widely known that unmigrated accounts can no longer be used to log into official launcher, and there is almost nothing you can do with them on **minecraft.net** website, except migrate. However, some third-party launchers, such as [PolyMC](https://polymc.org), still offer the option to log into the game from Mojang account, even though it is not possible to play multiplayer in such case. This raised the question in my mind: how much <em>exactly</em> can still be done with unmigrated account?
