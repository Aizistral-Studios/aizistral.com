While I wish this could have been conducted sooner, this is the first verifiable ban case where I could contact the person banned. Some couple weeks ago I even purchased second Minecraft account with the sole intent of committing what would appear as bannable offense and being reported by one of my friends afterwards, which I sucessfully did; however, no action from moderation team followed. At the time this lead me to conclude that reports are not yet actioned on, which was perfectly explainable by [unfixed exploits with chat reporting in 1.19.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH_q7ZuCJs0). This case might indicate that reports are indeed actioned now, at least since the date of this research, but it is also possible that ban occured due to automated chat monitoring on Realms (see {% include link_with_icon.html url="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/8047895358605-Our-Commitment-to-Player-Safety#h_01G95X76WR1PM97XBXDE7G25KE" svg="/assets/icons/paper.svg" name="Our Commitment to Player Safety - Proactive Moderation" %}). More details on that in ["Speculations"](#user-content-speculations) section.
